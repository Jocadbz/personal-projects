# Based, BAD INTERPRETED LANGUAGE

- "You should Use Rust!" - Random Rustacean

A based, bad interpreted language.

### Warning

I have **NO** idea of how to write a parser.
This is probably the worst code you've ever seen.

### Writing in BBIL

I don't know why you would do that but...

Just refer to the `example.bbil`. It will teach you everything.

### Building BBIL

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/Jocadbz/bbil.git
cd bbil
v . -prod
```

*Made... in V... btw...*
