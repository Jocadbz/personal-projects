# BASED COREUTILS

- *What?* - A friend
- *Death to busybox* - Random user on IRC
- *You call THIS coreutils?* - Richard Stallman

Non-useful, and mostly non-functional replacements to GNU coreutils (or Busybox, if you took the redpill and went full Alpine on your servers)


### Instalation
From Source:
```bash
# You will need the V compiler
git clone https://gitlab.com/Jocadbz/based-coreutils.git
cd based-coreutils
v (File)
```

### Why you SHOULD NOT use this
These are utilities that are designed to be written in the worst possible way
If you actually need useful coreutils written in V check [V's Coreutils](https://github.com/vlang/coreutils)

*Written in V, btw*
