V's Sex
============

This is a rewrite on one of the oldest programs available on the internet: "sex".
It was rewritten in V as a proof of concept.

This is the program "sex," a long-time orphaned program on the net.
The original author is unknown and wasn't in the comments in the code.
Nick Johnson cleaned up a few things, wrote a manpage, reworked word wrapping, 
and Mikhail Teterin wrote the Makefile.(Props to them)

On this Repo you will find the rewritten version (sex.v), as well the
original version (sex-old.c), provided for comparation porpouses.
